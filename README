GETTING STARTED
1) Install Ruby

3) run the 'bundle' command in the command line
4) Start server using the command 'ruby app.rb' from the top level of the project directory
5) From another command line prompt run 'ruby test_cases.rb', this will start an instance to interact with the server. You can use the example commands to pass information and write to the test.erb.
6) Got to http://localhost:4567/test to see html view/rendered of the output. The server should write to the erb file that is loaded when you go to the 'http://localhost:4567/test' URL



Other Notes:

PAYLOAD
:creative_uuid vs :image -- I've written the template so that either can be used
:use_promotional_cta: False -- CANNOT use 'False', ruby recognizes capital letters to indicate a class object. Payload will have to use a lower case 'false' instead
